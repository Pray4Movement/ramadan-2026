msgid "Islam is a works-based religion. The more faithfully Muslims practice the five pillars of Islam, the better their chances are of entering paradise. Today, as we pray through Matthew 5:3 for Muslims in this location, focus especially on how essential poverty of spirit (humility) is in entering the kingdom of heaven."

msgid "Dina did everything she could to make herself clean before God, including wearing the niqab, her traditional Muslim head covering. She was so confident in her own righteousness that when she met a Christian, she agreed to read the Bible so that she could prove to him that it was wrong. But God met her during those days and showed her how completely impoverished she was before a holy God. She surrendered to Jesus and now lives in humble circumstances so that she can more effectively share the Good News with others. Pray for believers to be led by the Holy Spirit in how to model these words of Jesus to be \"poor in spirit\" in their neighborhoods, workplaces, families, and communities."

The extra money would get her one step closer to the amount she needed to pay for the government-subsidized omra (pilgrimage to Mecca). Her life had been a hard one, filled with manual labor, the death of a baby, the disappearance of a grown child, and the struggle to support her living children through her low-wage house cleaning. She thought that if she could make this trip to Mecca happen, then she could take back a little bit of her sense of powerlessness and improve her chances of going to heaven when she died.

However, it's not rare to hear Muslim relatives of the deceased being scolded for crying at a funeral.

Consider how Muslims might face devastating loss and how these words of Jesus could bring hope."

msgid "\"My brothers won't let me go see her. If we go to her grave now and ask Jesus, will he raise her from the dead?\" Leila's heartbroken question about her late mom revealed the depth of her grief, the strength of her faith, and the mystery of sovereign sorrow. She knew the truth about Lazarus's story. She believed that God has complete authority over life and death and that Jesus himself is the resurrection and the life. And she knew that Jesus promises to comfort the mourning and so acknowledges that we will have sorrow. He is \"acquainted with grief and carries our sorrows\" (Isaiah 53). Some of her unbelieving relatives did not know of her faith and criticized how she mourned, but she had a dream that Jesus himself came across the waves to her, holding out arms of comfort. Pray that believers here will not lose sight of Jesus in their grief but will cry out to him and receive comfort."

Those who have not yet entered the kingdom of God mourn without hope. In their desperation and desire to blame someone—anyone—they often do things that they are later ashamed of. Pray for all those mourning who do not yet know Jesus to feel the weight of their hopelessness and turn to call on the name of the Lord.

It is very difficult when parents die who have not heard of Jesus or who have not chosen to follow him. One brother, when his mom died, did not want to think about eternity. He had followed Jesus for many years and had not specifically told her the gospel. This despair of wondering about her eternity caused him to pull away from other believers and from Jesus. Lord, we ask for wisdom and compassion that speaks the truth of the One Way to the Father and also acknowledges that grief sometimes warps our understanding. We thank you for knowing each heart and the faith that has been confessed, or that was still hidden. Please help your church to know how to comfort the mourning in truth."

msgid "Meekness has several meanings: \"enduring injury without resentment,\" or \"humbly patient under provocation,\" or \"gentle; kind”. Jesus shows us meekness by being “obedient unto death, even death on the cross\" (Phil 2). \"Like a lamb before his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth\" (Isaiah 53). He declared himself to be \"meek and gentle of heart,\" and in Him we find \"rest for our souls\" (Matthew 11:29). Mohammed's life was one of battle. He told his followers, “A life for a life, eye for an eye, nose for a nose.” Pray for those still in Islam to see the spectacular beauty of grace and forgiveness found in Jesus. Jesus gave up great honor to come to earth and was disgraced at the cross. Pray that people will be ready to be dishonored on earth so that Jesus will be honored."

You must fight for your rights, speak up, find your voice, and take what you deserve. Jesus declares that the meek, the humble, inherit the earth. Theirs is the inheritance. Not because they step on others to grab for more. No. Those who quietly submit to God, who can bear an insult or return a soft answer, who are patient—these will inherit the earth. The influence of the meek and self-controlled is, in the long run, greater than that of the impulsive and demanding."

msgid "True righteousness is achieved only through the blood of Jesus, with him being \"made sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Cor 5:21). For all human beings, including Muslims, our tendency is to think that somehow, if we work hard enough, pray the right way, give sacrificially enough, fast severely enough, we will gain favor with God by our own righteousness. This self-righteous thinking spits on the cross and declares Jesus' blood unnecessary. Forgive us, Lord. May Muslims—and all people—see that the Scriptures repeatedly reveal that we cannot make ourselves righteous. May Muslims feel the weight of the impossibility of rescuing themselves and instead hunger and thirst for true righteousness through the cross."

But Asmae sat on the floor, her back against the wall, reading the words of Jesus, completely ignoring everything else. One of the children fell and her toe bled, but Asmae continued to read, hungry to hear and know Jesus. She knew that dinner needed to be made, and many tasks for her large family were left undone. Asmae wondered how she could keep learning about Jesus with so many demands on her life and time. This first love of Jesus and His Word was beautiful and all-consuming. In the end, her many responsibilities and fears pushed aside reading the words of Jesus. Pray for believers to return to their first love and be satisfied only with Jesus."

Maryam asked one of them, \"Do you know the story of Noah? Of Moses?\" When she heard about the ark and how God provided only one way of rescue from the flood, she said, \"That is grace.\" \"Yes,\" the believer agreed, \"there is no other way to live except the one way of salvation,\" and she went on to quote John 1:4-5. Maryam, shockingly, agreed verbally and then went on to ask about Moses, listening as the woman told about the Passover Lamb and how Jesus Himself was that Lamb. She said, \"I love to hear these stories. I want to come and listen to them again. Let's meet again at this shop.\" Praise God for her hunger. Although the believer has gone to the shop most days, they have not seen each other there again. Pray that Maryam's hunger and thirst will be satisfied in Jesus, that she will listen to true stories of Jesus from other believers, and that she will share the stories with others.

msgid "One of the 99 names of God that Muslims often reference is “God the Merciful.” It is the one hope many Muslims hold on to when they acknowledge they have no assurance of salvation. Though they would never articulate it, they are hoping that God's mercy will trump His justice. Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection is the only way God can be completely merciful and just at the same time. Today, as we pray Matthew 5:7 for these people God loves, contemplate what Christian mercy means—we can be merciful because we can trust in a merciful and just God."

Jewish priests, as well, from the time of Moses, were washed in water and sprinkled with blood before entering the holy places, recognizing the need for purity. “But these could never truly purify the worshiper.” (Heb 9:10)  When Christ appeared, he entered once and for all into the holy places by his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.\" “how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.\" (Hebrews 9:14) ESV This is the way to purity.

Let them love you, know you, and do the will of the Father. Those who love you, will obey you. (John 15:14)"

And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” (Matthew 7:24-27) ESV"

These are all things that cannot endure the floods and the winds of life. Pray for them to have the chance to learn of the Rock of Psalm 18:2, \"The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.\""

msgid "Riyadh grew up as a Muslim but came to faith in Christ as a young man. Despite persecution and losing relationships with family members, he held on to Jesus as his pearl of great price. He married a believer from his people group, and together, they began to build their lives based on the Bible, although they had few Christian examples to follow. They read the Bible, and Riyadh led his family in building their lives upon the Rock. Today, not only do their children follow Jesus, but God uses this couple to multiply His church by allowing them to teach others how to be disciples who make disciples.  The rain has fallen, floods came, winds blew, but they are steadfast because they trust Jesus' words. Pray for leaders like Riyadh and his wife to multiply themselves into many other leaders in this region."

msgid "It started with cheating on exams in school. Then there was lying to parents and teachers...telling his fiancee what she wanted to hear… cutting corners, fudging accounts, taking a little here, and borrowing a little there. “As long as I don’t get caught,” Ali tells himself, “what's the harm?” As long as he stays ahead of the creditors... as long as he doesn't let his friends from different circles get to know each other. It's all fine until the house of cards starts to crumble. Ali, and many like him in this place, build their lives upon the sand and cannot stand when unexpected floods and winds come. Pray that when their world crumbles, they will have the opportunity to read Jesus' teachings, be convicted of the truth, and choose a different path. Pray that their testimony of transformation would result in friends and family also wanting to investigate the teachings of Jesus."

msgid "Obedience brings stability. When we obey Jesus' commandments, we remain in his love. (John 15:10) This is the foundation, the rock we build upon. The love of God revealed in the sacrificial love of Jesus on the cross -- this is unshakable. Suffering and persecution may come, but nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. He who did not spare his own Son, how will he not also give us all things? Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? Who will condemn us? (Romans 8:32-33) Pray that disciples in this place will not only hear the words of Jesus and believe the words of Jesus but also obey the words of Jesus and rest in the steadfastness of his love."

"As Muslims leave the mosque tonight and begin to prepare for Eid, the celebration to mark the end of Ramadan, we pray many will be filled with a desire to read the Injil (New Testament). We pray for God to increase the access they have to 'hearing these words' of Jesus online or in bookshops. We pray for them to begin to discover its truth. As they put into practice the things they read, may they experience the blessing that comes from being like the wise man in this teaching (Matthew 7:24-27). We pray for groups of friends and family members who go to the mosque together to begin to read God's Word together and be transformed."

We confess that there are those in this area who have \"forsaken [God], the spring of living water and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.\" (Jeremiah 2:13) Reveal their brokenness to their own hearts, Lord. Let them see that before their eyes is a spring of life, that their endless striving to build something themselves is futile. Houses built on sand will be destroyed and can never provide shelter. Cisterns that leak can never quench thirst. Please, Jesus, let them see that your Word is true, that obeying you brings life and rest."

When he came across the authority of Jesus' teaching in this sermon -- especially his command that a person should \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\", Yosri realized Jesus was the only way to true life. He forgave his abuser and experienced profound freedom. No one could hold him back from boldly sharing the Good News he found.

"Lord, we lift our voices together one last time. Thank you for these 31 days of prayer for our brothers and sisters in this land. Today, we remember our brothers and sisters across the whole Muslim world, and we declare The Good News that Christ, and not Caesar, reigns as Lord and Ruler of the Cosmos. Let this truth be heard in Mecca, the announcement that God’s Anointed, Jesus, rules as King. Let it be shared in Baghdad and Cairo that Christ has thrown down death and conquered the grave of exile. From Libya and Tunisia to Somalia and Sudan, from the islands of Indonesia to the mountains of Pakistan, from India to Iran, from the Gulf countries to the Levant and to Turkey, through all the war-torn towns, cities, and villages of Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria: let the good news of the saving grace of Jesus, our Lord, be preached… spread…and incarnated into the world by followers of Jesus. Let men and women, children, and whole families be baptized into the community of saints. and be filled with the presence and power of God’s indwelling Holy Spirit. And then the end will come. And finally, Lord, the Lamb of God shall receive the full reward of His suffering…in and for the Muslim world...to the great glory and praise of You, our God and Father. At long last, let Your children come running home.\n"
