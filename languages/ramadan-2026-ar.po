"Genesis 1:1-25 (ESV)\n"
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was "
"without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the "
"Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be "
"light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God "
"divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the "
"darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first "
"day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and "
"let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and "
"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were "
"above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And "
"the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the "
"waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry "
"land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the "
"gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was "
"good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, "
"and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, "
"upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb "
"yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in "
"itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and "
"the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the "
"firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be "
"for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for "
"lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it "
"was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, "
"and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set "
"them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to "
"rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the "
"darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were "
"the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the "
"moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the "
"open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living "
"creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their "
"kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. "
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters "
"in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the "
"morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the "
"living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the "
"earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth "
"after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth "
"upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."

"she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall "

"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD "
"God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not "
"eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may "
"eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree "
"which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, "
"neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, "
"Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, "
"then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and "
"evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it "
"was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she "
"took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with "
"her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew "
"that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made "
"themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the "
"garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the "
"presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. And the LORD God "
"called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard "
"thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid "
"myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of "
"the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man "
"said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and "
"I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast "
"done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the "
"LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed "
"above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt "
"thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put "
"enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it "
"shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Unto the woman he "
"said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou "
"shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he "
"shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened "
"unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded "
"thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; "
"in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and "
"thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the "

"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said "
"unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take now thy "
"son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of "
"Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains "
"which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and "
"saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, "
"and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the "
"place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his "
"eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide "
"ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come "
"again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it "
"upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they "
"went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and "
"said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the "
"fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham "
"said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they "
"went both of them together. And they came to the place which God had told "
"him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and "
"bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham "
"stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel "
"of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and "
"he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do "
"thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou "
"hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. And Abraham lifted up his "
"eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his "
"horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt "
"offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place "
"Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall "
"be seen. And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the "
"second time, And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because "
"thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: "
"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy "
"seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea "

"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there "
"arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the "
"works which he had done for Israel. And the children of Israel did evil in "
"the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim: And they forsook the LORD God of "
"their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed "
"other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed "
"themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. And they forsook the "
"LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the LORD was hot "
"against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that "
"spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, "
"so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. Whithersoever "
"they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD "
"had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly "
"distressed. Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out "
"of the hand of those that spoiled them. And yet they would not hearken unto "
"their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves "
"unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, "
"obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so. And when the LORD "
"raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them "
"out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented "
"the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them "
"and vexed them. And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they "
"returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following "
"other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from "
"their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. And the anger of the LORD was "
"hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed "
"my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my "
"voice; I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the "
"nations which Joshua left when he died: That through them I may prove "
"Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their "

"(because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary "

"present to heal them. And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was "

"because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down "
"through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. And when he "
"saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. And the "
"scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which "
"speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? But when Jesus "
"perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in "
"your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to "
"say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power "
"upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto "
"thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. And immediately "
"he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his "
"own house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, "
"and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. And "
"after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at "
"the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. And he left all, "

"took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other "
"little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into "
"the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the "
"ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, "
"carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said "
"unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great "
"calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have "
"no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner "
"of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came over "
"unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And when "

"man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man "
"could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound "

"with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that "
"thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean "

"them away out of the country. Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a "
"great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send "

"mind: and they were afraid. And they that saw it told them how it befell to "
"him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. And "
"they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. And when he was come "
"into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he "
"might be with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go "

"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they "
"were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to "
"pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and "
"prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, "
"extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in "
"the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing "
"afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon "
"his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man "
"went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that "
"exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be "
"exalted. And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: "
"but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto "
"him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: "
"for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall "
"not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter "
"therein. And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do "
"to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? "
"none is good, save one, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not "
"commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, "
"Honour thy father and thy mother. And he said, All these have I kept from my "
"youth up. Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest "
"thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and "
"thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. And when he heard "
"this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. And when Jesus saw that "
"he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter "
"into the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through a "
"needle\\'s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And "

"The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. And great "
"multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and "
"sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. And he spake many things "
"unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; And when "
"he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured "
"them up: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and "
"forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when "
"the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they "
"withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and "
"choked them: But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some "
"an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear, let "
"him hear.\n"
"\n"
"Matthew 13:18-23 (ESV)\n"
"Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of "
"the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and "
"catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received "
"seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into stony places, the "
"same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath "
"he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or "
"persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also "
"that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the "
"care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he "
"becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he "
"that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and "

"John 11:1-44 (ESV)\n"
"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and "
"her sister Martha. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, "
"and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) Therefore "
"his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is "
"sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but "
"for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Now "
"Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore "
"that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. "
"Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. His "
"disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and "
"goest thou thither again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the "
"day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the "
"light of this world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because "
"there is no light in him. These things said he: and after that he saith unto "
"them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of "
"sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit "
"Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of "
"rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am "
"glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; "
"nevertheless let us go unto him. Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, "
"unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. Then "
"when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. "
"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: And many of "
"the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. "
"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: "
"but Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou "
"hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, "
"whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto "
"her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he "

"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she "
"stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white "
"sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of "
"Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith "
"unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they "
"have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw "
"Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, "
"why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, "
"saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast "
"laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned "
"herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith "
"unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my "
"brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and "
"to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she "
"had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then the "
"same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were "
"shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and "
"stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had "
"so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples "
"glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto "
"you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said "
"this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: "
"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever "
"sins ye retain, they are retained. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called "
"Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore "
"said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall "
"see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of "
"the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after "
"eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came "
"Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto "
"you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; "
"and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, "
"but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. "
"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: "

"Revelation 7:9-17 (ESV)\n"
"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, "
"of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the "
"throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their "
"hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which "
"sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round "
"about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before "
"the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and "
"glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be "
"unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying "
"unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came "
"they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are "
"they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and "
"made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the "
"throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that "
"sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, "
"neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. "
"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall "
"lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears "
"from their eyes."

"ثُمَّ نَظَرْتُ، فَرَأَيْتُ جَمْعاً كَثِيراً لاَ يُحْصَى، مِنْ كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ وَقَبِيلَةٍ "
"وَشَعْبٍ وَلُغَةٍ، وَاقِفِينَ أَمَامَ الْعَرْشِ وَأَمَامَ الْحَمَلِ، وَقَدِ ارْتَدَوْا "
"ثِيَاباً بَيْضَاءَ، وَأَمْسَكُوا بِأَيْدِيهِمْ سَعَفَ النَّخْلِ، وَهُمْ يَهْتِفُونَ بِصَوْتٍ "
"عَالٍ: «الْخَلاَصُ مِنْ عِنْدِ إِلَهِنَا الْجَالِسِ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَمِنْ عِنْدِ الْحَمَلِ!» "
"وَاجْتَمَعَ الْمَلاَئِكَةُ جَمِيعاً حَوْلَ الْعَرْشِ، وَمَعَهُمُ الشُّيُوخُ وَالْكَائِنَاتُ "
"الْحَيَّةُ الأَرْبَعَةُ، وَخَرُّوا عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ أَمَامَ الْعَرْشِ سُجُوداً لِلهِ، "
"قَائِلِينَ: «آمِين! لإِلَهِنَا الْبَرَكَةُ وَالْمَجْدُ وَالْحِكْمَةُ وَالشُّكْرُ وَالإِجْلالُ "
"وَالْقُدْرَةُ وَالْقُوَّةُ إِلَى أَبَدِ الآبِدِينَ. آمِين!» وَسَأَلَنِي أَحَدُ الشُّيُوخِ: "
"«أَتَعْلَمُ مَنْ هُمْ هَؤُلاَءِ الَّذِينَ يَرْتَدُونَ الثِّيَابَ الْبَيْضَاءَ، وَهَلْ "
"تَعْرِفُ مِنْ أَيْنَ أَتَوْا؟» فَأَجَبْتُهُ: «أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ يَاسَيِّدِي!» فَقَالَ: "
"«هَؤُلاَءِ هُمُ الَّذِينَ أَتَوْا مِنَ الضِّيقَةِ الْعَظِيمَةِ، وَقَدْ غَسَّلُوا ثِيَابَهُمْ "
"وَبَيَّضُوهَا بِدَمِ الْحَمَلِ. لِهَذَا هُمْ أَمَامَ عَرْشِ اللهِ يَخْدِمُونَهُ فِي "
"هَيْكَلِهِ لَيْلاً وَنَهَاراً وَالْجَالِسُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يَبْسُطُ خَيْمَتَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ، "
"فَلَنْ يَجُوعُوا وَلَنْ يَعْطَشُوا، وَلَنْ تَضْرِبَهُمُ الشَّمْسُ وَلاَ أَيُّ حَرٍّ، "
"لأَنَّ الْحَمَلَ الَّذِي فِي وَسَطِ الْعَرْشِ يَرْعَاهُمْ وَيَقُودُهُمْ إِلَى يَنَابِيعِ "
"مَاءِ الْحَيَاةِ، وَيَمْسَحُ اللهُ كُلَّ دَمْعَةٍ مِنْ عُيُونِهِمْ»."
