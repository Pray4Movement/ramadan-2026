"Genesis 1:1-25 (ESV)\n"
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was "
"without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the "
"Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be "
"light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God "
"divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the "
"darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first "
"day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and "
"let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and "
"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were "
"above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And "
"the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the "
"waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry "
"land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the "
"gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was "
"good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, "
"and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, "
"upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb "
"yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in "
"itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and "
"the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the "
"firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be "
"for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for "
"lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it "
"was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, "
"and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set "
"them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to "
"rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the "
"darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were "
"the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the "
"moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the "
"open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living "
"creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their "
"kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. "
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters "
"in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the "
"morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the "
"living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the "
"earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth "
"after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth "
"upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."

"Au commencement, Dieu créa les cieux et la terre. La terre était informe et "
"vide: il y avait des ténèbres à la surface de l'abîme, et l'esprit de Dieu "
"se mouvait au-dessus des eaux. Dieu dit: Que la lumière soit! Et la lumière "
"fut. Dieu vit que la lumière était bonne; et Dieu sépara la lumière d'avec "
"les ténèbres. Dieu appela la lumière jour, et il appela les ténèbres nuit. "
"Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le premier jour. Dieu "
"dit: Qu'il y ait une étendue entre les eaux, et qu'elle sépare les eaux "
"d'avec les eaux. Et Dieu fit l'étendue, et il sépara les eaux qui sont au-"
"dessous de l'étendue d'avec les eaux qui sont au-dessus de l'étendue. Et "
"cela fut ainsi. Dieu appela l'étendue ciel. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il "
"y eut un matin: ce fut le second jour. Dieu dit: Que les eaux qui sont au-"
"dessous du ciel se rassemblent en un seul lieu, et que le sec paraisse. Et "
"cela fut ainsi. Dieu appela le sec terre, et il appela l'amas des eaux "
"mers. Dieu vit que cela était bon. Puis Dieu dit: Que la terre produise de "
"la verdure, de l'herbe portant de la semence, des arbres fruitiers donnant "
"du fruit selon leur espèce et ayant en eux leur semence sur la terre. Et "
"cela fut ainsi. La terre produisit de la verdure, de l'herbe portant de la "
"semence selon son espèce, et des arbres donnant du fruit et ayant en eux "
"leur semence selon leur espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon. Ainsi, il y "
"eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le troisième jour. Dieu dit: "
"Qu'il y ait des luminaires dans l'étendue du ciel, pour séparer le jour "
"d'avec la nuit; que ce soient des signes pour marquer les époques, les "
"jours et les années; et qu'ils servent de luminaires dans l'étendue du "
"ciel, pour éclairer la terre. Et cela fut ainsi. Dieu fit les deux grands "
"luminaires, le plus grand luminaire pour présider au jour, et le plus petit "
"luminaire pour présider à la nuit; il fit aussi les étoiles. Dieu les plaça "
"dans l'étendue du ciel, pour éclairer la terre, pour présider au jour et à "
"la nuit, et pour séparer la lumière d'avec les ténèbres. Dieu vit que cela "
"était bon. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le "
"quatrième jour. Dieu dit: Que les eaux produisent en abondance des animaux "
"vivants, et que des oiseaux volent sur la terre vers l'étendue du ciel. "
"Dieu créa les grands poissons et tous les animaux vivants qui se meuvent, "
"et que les eaux produisirent en abondance selon leur espèce; il créa aussi "
"tout oiseau ailé selon son espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon. Dieu les "
"bénit, en disant: Soyez féconds, multipliez, et remplissez les eaux des "
"mers; et que les oiseaux multiplient sur la terre. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, "
"et il y eut un matin: ce fut le cinquième jour. Dieu dit: Que la terre "
"produise des animaux vivants selon leur espèce, du bétail, des reptiles et "
"des animaux terrestres, selon leur espèce. Et cela fut ainsi. Dieu fit les "
"animaux de la terre selon leur espèce, le bétail selon son espèce, et tous "
"les reptiles de la terre selon leur espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon."

"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD "
"God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not "
"eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may "
"eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree "
"which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, "
"neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, "
"Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, "
"then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and "
"evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it "
"was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she "
"took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with "
"her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew "
"that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made "
"themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the "
"garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the "
"presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. And the LORD God "
"called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard "
"thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid "
"myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of "
"the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man "
"said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and "
"I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast "
"done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the "
"LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed "
"above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt "
"thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put "
"enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it "
"shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Unto the woman he "
"said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou "
"shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he "
"shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened "
"unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded "
"thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; "
"in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and "
"thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the "
"field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto "
"the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust "
"shalt thou return. And Adam called his wife\\'s name Eve; because she was "
"the mother of all living. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God "
"make coats of skins, and clothed them. And the LORD God said, Behold, the "
"man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put "
"forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for "
"ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till "
"the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed "

"marcheras sur ton ventre, et tu mangeras de la poussière tous les jours de "
"ta vie. Je mettrai inimitié entre toi et la femme, entre ta postérité et sa "
"postérité: celle-ci t'écrasera la tête, et tu lui blesseras le talon. Il "
"dit à la femme: J'augmenterai la souffrance de tes grossesses, tu "
"enfanteras avec douleur, et tes désirs se porteront vers ton mari, mais il "
"dominera sur toi. Il dit à l'homme: Puisque tu as écouté la voix de ta "
"femme, et que tu as mangé de l'arbre au sujet duquel je t'avais donné cet "
"ordre: Tu n'en mangeras point! Le sol sera maudit à cause de toi. C'est à "

"des habits de peau, et il les en revêtit. L'Éternel Dieu dit: Voici, "
"l'homme est devenu comme l'un de nous, pour la connaissance du bien et du "
"mal. Empêchons-le maintenant d'avancer sa main, de prendre de l'arbre de "
"vie, d'en manger, et de vivre éternellement. Et l'Éternel Dieu le chassa du "

"En ce temps-là parut un édit de César Auguste, ordonnant un recensement de "

"Joseph aussi monta de la Galilée, de la ville de Nazareth, pour se rendre "
"en Judée, dans la ville de David, appelée Bethléhem, parce qu'il était de "
"la maison et de la famille de David, afin de se faire inscrire avec Marie, "
"sa fiancée, qui était enceinte. Pendant qu'ils étaient là, le temps où "
"Marie devait accoucher arriva, et elle enfanta son fils premier-né. Elle "
"l'emmaillota, et le coucha dans une crèche, parce qu'il n'y avait pas de "

"bergers qui passaient dans les champs les veilles de la nuit pour garder "
"leurs troupeaux. Et voici, un ange du Seigneur leur apparut, et la gloire "
"du Seigneur resplendit autour d'eux. Ils furent saisis d'une grande "
"frayeur. Mais l'ange leur dit: Ne craignez point; car je vous annonce une "
"bonne nouvelle, qui sera pour tout le peuple le sujet d'une grande joie: "
"c'est qu'aujourd'hui, dans la ville de David, il vous est né un Sauveur, "
"qui est le Christ, le Seigneur. Et voici à quel signe vous le reconnaîtrez: "
"vous trouverez un enfant emmailloté et couché dans une crèche. Et soudain "
"il se joignit à l'ange une multitude de l'armée céleste, louant Dieu et "
"disant: Gloire à Dieu dans les lieux très hauts, Et paix sur la terre parmi "
"les hommes qu'il agrée! Lorsque les anges les eurent quittés pour retourner "
"au ciel, les bergers se dirent les uns aux autres: Allons jusqu'à "
"Bethléhem, et voyons ce qui est arrivé, ce que le Seigneur nous a fait "
"connaître. Ils y allèrent en hâte, et ils trouvèrent Marie et Joseph, et le "
"petit enfant couché dans la crèche. Après l'avoir vu, ils racontèrent ce "
"qui leur avait été dit au sujet de ce petit enfant. Tous ceux qui les "
"entendirent furent dans l'étonnement de ce que leur disaient les bergers. "

"And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass "
"over unto the other side. And when they had sent away the multitude, they "
"took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other "
"little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into "
"the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the "
"ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, "
"carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said "
"unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great "
"calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have "
"no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner "
"of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came over "
"unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And when "
"he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a "
"man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man "
"could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound "
"with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and "
"the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. And always, "
"night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and "
"cutting himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and "
"worshipped him, And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do "
"with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that "
"thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean "
"spirit. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name "

"great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send "

"them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: "
"and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about "
"two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. And they that fed the swine fled, "

"Ce même jour, sur le soir, Jésus leur dit: Passons à l'autre bord. Après "
"avoir renvoyé la foule, ils l'emmenèrent dans la barque où il se trouvait; "
"il y avait aussi d'autres barques avec lui. Il s'éleva un grand tourbillon, "

"déjà. Et lui, il dormait à la poupe sur le coussin. Ils le réveillèrent, et "

"réveillé, il menaça le vent, et dit à la mer: Silence! Tais-toi! Et le vent "
"cessa, et il y eut un grand calme. Puis il leur dit: Pourquoi avez-vous "
"ainsi peur? Comment n'avez-vous point de foi? Ils furent saisis d'une "
"grande frayeur, et ils se dirent les uns aux autres: Quel est donc celui-"
"ci, à qui obéissent même le vent et la mer? Ils arrivèrent à l'autre bord "
"de la mer, dans le pays des Gadaréniens. Aussitôt que Jésus fut hors de la "
"barque, il vint au-devant de lui un homme, sortant des sépulcres, et "
"possédé d'un esprit impur. Cet homme avait sa demeure dans les sépulcres, "
"et personne ne pouvait plus le lier, même avec une chaîne. Car souvent il "
"avait eu les fers aux pieds et avait été lié de chaînes, mais il avait "
"rompu les chaînes et brisé les fers, et personne n'avait la force de le "
"dompter. Il était sans cesse, nuit et jour, dans les sépulcres et sur les "
"montagnes, criant, et se meurtrissant avec des pierres. Ayant vu Jésus de "
"loin, il accourut, se prosterna devant lui, et s'écria d'une voix forte: "
"Qu'y a-t-il entre moi et toi, Jésus, Fils du Dieu Très-Haut? Je t'en "
"conjure au nom de Dieu, ne me tourmente pas. Car Jésus lui disait: Sors de "
"cet homme, esprit impur! Et, il lui demanda: Quel est ton nom? Légion est "
"mon nom, lui répondit-il, car nous sommes plusieurs. Et il le priait "
"instamment de ne pas les envoyer hors du pays. Il y avait là, vers la "
"montagne, un grand troupeau de pourceaux qui paissaient. Et les démons le "
"prièrent, disant: Envoie-nous dans ces pourceaux, afin que nous entrions en "
"eux. Il le leur permit. Et les esprits impurs sortirent, entrèrent dans les "
"pourceaux, et le troupeau se précipita des pentes escarpées dans la mer: il "
"y en avait environ deux mille, et ils se noyèrent dans la mer. Ceux qui les "
"faisaient paître s'enfuirent, et répandirent la nouvelle dans la ville et "
"dans les campagnes. Les gens allèrent voir ce qui était arrivé. Ils vinrent "
"auprès de Jésus, et ils virent le démoniaque, celui qui avait eu la légion, "
"assis, vêtu, et dans son bon sens; et ils furent saisis de frayeur. Ceux "
"qui avaient vu ce qui s'était passé leur racontèrent ce qui était arrivé au "
"démoniaque et aux pourceaux. Alors ils se mirent à supplier Jésus de "
"quitter leur territoire. Comme il montait dans la barque, celui qui avait "
"été démoniaque lui demanda la permission de rester avec lui. Jésus ne le "
"lui permit pas, mais il lui dit: Va dans ta maison, vers les tiens, et "

"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they "

"prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, "
"extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in "
"the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing "

"his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man "
"went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that "
"exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be "
"exalted. And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: "
"but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto "
"him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: "
"for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall "
"not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter "
"therein. And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do "
"to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? "
"none is good, save one, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not "
"commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, "
"Honour thy father and thy mother. And he said, All these have I kept from my "
"youth up. Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest "
"thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and "
"thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. And when he heard "
"this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. And when Jesus saw that "
"he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter "
"into the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through a "
"needle\\'s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And "
"they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? And he said, The things "
"which are impossible with men are possible with God. Then Peter said, Lo, we "
"have left all, and followed thee. And he said unto them, Verily I say unto "

"Il dit encore cette parabole, en vue de certaines personnes se persuadant "

"de ce que je ne suis pas comme le reste des hommes, qui sont ravisseurs, "

"Pourquoi m'appelles-tu bon? Il n'y a de bon que Dieu seul. Tu connais les "
"commandements: Tu ne commettras point d'adultère; tu ne tueras point; tu ne "
"déroberas point; tu ne diras point de faux témoignage; honore ton père et "

"que tu as, distribue-le aux pauvres, et tu auras un trésor dans les cieux. "
"Puis, viens, et suis-moi. Lorsqu'il entendit ces paroles, il devint tout "

"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, "
"what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written "
"in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the "
"Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy "

"unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, "
"willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? And "
"Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and "
"fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and "
"departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain "
"priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And "
"likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and "
"passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came "
"where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, And went to "
"him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his "
"own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the "
"morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, "
"and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when "
"I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, "
"was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that "
"shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.\n"

"Un docteur de la loi se leva, et dit à Jésus, pour l'éprouver: Maître, que "
"dois-je faire pour hériter la vie éternelle? Jésus lui dit: Qu'est-il écrit "
"dans la loi? Qu'y lis-tu? Il répondit: Tu aimeras le Seigneur, ton Dieu, de "

"et ton prochain comme toi-même. Tu as bien répondu, lui dit Jésus; fais "

"you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the "

"find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, "

"and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before "

"devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. "

"John 11:1-44 (ESV)\n"
"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and "
"her sister Martha. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, "
"and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) Therefore "
"his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is "
"sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but "
"for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Now "
"Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore "
"that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. "
"Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. His "
"disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and "
"goest thou thither again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the "
"day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the "
"light of this world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because "
"there is no light in him. These things said he: and after that he saith unto "
"them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of "
"sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit "
"Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of "
"rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am "
"glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; "
"nevertheless let us go unto him. Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, "
"unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. Then "
"when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. "
"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: And many of "
"the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. "
"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: "
"but Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou "
"hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, "
"whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto "
"her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he "
"shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I "
"am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were "
"dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall "
"never die. Believest thou this? She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe "
"that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. "
"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister "
"secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. As soon as she "
"heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. Now Jesus was not yet come "
"into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. The Jews then "
"which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, "
"that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto "
"the grave to weep there. Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw "
"him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been "
"here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the "
"Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was "
"troubled, And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come "
"and see. Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! And some "
"of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have "
"caused that even this man should not have died? Jesus therefore again "
"groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon "
"it. Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was "
"dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead "
"four days. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou "
"wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away "
"the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his "
"eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew "
"that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said "
"it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had "
"spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was "
"dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was "
"bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."

"Il y avait un homme malade, Lazare, de Béthanie, village de Marie et de "
"Marthe, sa sœur. C'était cette Marie qui oignit de parfum le Seigneur et qui "
"lui essuya les pieds avec ses cheveux, et c'était son frère Lazare qui était "
"malade. Les sœurs envoyèrent dire à Jésus: Seigneur, voici, celui que tu "
"aimes est malade. Après avoir entendu cela, Jésus dit: Cette maladie n'est "
"point à la mort; mais elle est pour la gloire de Dieu, afin que le Fils de "
"Dieu soit glorifié par elle. Or, Jésus aimait Marthe, et sa sœur, et Lazare. "
"Lors donc qu'il eut appris que Lazare était malade, il resta deux jours "
"encore dans le lieu où il était, et il dit ensuite aux disciples: Retournons "
"en Judée. Les disciples lui dirent: Rabbi, les Juifs tout récemment "
"cherchaient à te lapider, et tu retournes en Judée! Jésus répondit: N'y "
"a-t-il pas douze heures au jour? Si quelqu'un marche pendant le jour, il ne "
"bronche point, parce qu'il voit la lumière de ce monde; mais, si quelqu'un "
"marche pendant la nuit, il bronche, parce que la lumière n'est pas en lui. "
"Après ces paroles, il leur dit: Lazare, notre ami, dort; mais je vais le "
"réveiller. Les disciples lui dirent: Seigneur, s'il dort, il sera guéri. "
"Jésus avait parlé de sa mort, mais ils crurent qu'il parlait de "
"l'assoupissement du sommeil. Alors Jésus leur dit ouvertement: Lazare est "
"mort. Et, à cause de vous, afin que vous croyiez, je me réjouis de ce que je "
"n'étais pas là. Mais allons vers lui. Sur quoi Thomas, appelé Didyme, dit "
"aux autres disciples: Allons aussi, afin de mourir avec lui. Jésus, étant "
"arrivé, trouva que Lazare était déjà depuis quatre jours dans le sépulcre. "
"Et, comme Béthanie était près de Jérusalem, à quinze stades environ, "
"beaucoup de Juifs étaient venus vers Marthe et Marie, pour les consoler de "
"la mort de leur frère. Lorsque Marthe apprit que Jésus arrivait, elle alla "
"au-devant de lui, tandis que Marie se tenait assise à la maison. Marthe dit "
"à Jésus: Seigneur, si tu eusses été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort. Mais, "
"maintenant même, je sais que tout ce que tu demanderas à Dieu, Dieu te "
"l'accordera. Jésus lui dit: Ton frère ressuscitera. Je sais, lui répondit "
"Marthe, qu'il ressuscitera à la résurrection, au dernier jour. Jésus lui "
"dit: Je suis la résurrection et la vie. Celui qui croit en moi vivra, quand "
"même il serait mort; et quiconque vit et croit en moi ne mourra jamais. "
"Crois-tu cela? Elle lui dit: Oui, Seigneur, je crois que tu es le Christ, le "
"Fils de Dieu, qui devait venir dans le monde. Ayant ainsi parlé, elle s'en "
"alla. Puis elle appela secrètement Marie, sa sœur, et lui dit: Le maître est "
"ici, et il te demande. Dès que Marie eut entendu, elle se leva promptement, "
"et alla vers lui. Car Jésus n'était pas encore entré dans le village, mais "
"il était dans le lieu où Marthe l'avait rencontré. Les Juifs qui étaient "
"avec Marie dans la maison et qui la consolaient, l'ayant vue se lever "
"promptement et sortir, la suivirent, disant: Elle va au sépulcre, pour y "
"pleurer. Lorsque Marie fut arrivée là où était Jésus, et qu'elle le vit, "
"elle tomba à ses pieds, et lui dit: Seigneur, si tu eusses été ici, mon "
"frère ne serait pas mort. Jésus, la voyant pleurer, elle et les Juifs qui "
"étaient venus avec elle, frémit en son esprit, et fut tout ému. Et il dit: "
"Où l'avez-vous mis? Seigneur, lui répondirent-ils, viens et vois. Jésus "
"pleura. Sur quoi les Juifs dirent: Voyez comme il l'aimait. Et quelques-uns "
"d'entre eux dirent: Lui qui a ouvert les yeux de l'aveugle, ne pouvait-il "
"pas faire aussi que cet homme ne mourût point? Jésus frémissant de nouveau "
"en lui-même, se rendit au sépulcre. C'était une grotte, et une pierre était "
"placée devant. Jésus dit: Otez la pierre. Marthe, la sœur du mort, lui dit: "
"Seigneur, il sent déjà, car il y a quatre jours qu'il est là. Jésus lui dit: "
"Ne t'ai-je pas dit que, si tu crois, tu verras la gloire de Dieu? Ils "
"ôtèrent donc la pierre. Et Jésus leva les yeux en haut, et dit: Père, je te "
"rends grâces de ce que tu m'as exaucé. Pour moi, je savais que tu m'exauces "
"toujours; mais j'ai parlé à cause de la foule qui m'entoure, afin qu'ils "
"croient que c'est toi qui m'as envoyé. Ayant dit cela, il cria d'une voix "
"forte: Lazare, sors! Et le mort sortit, les pieds et les mains liés de "
"bandes, et le visage enveloppé d'un linge. Jésus leur dit: Déliez-le, et "
"laissez-le aller."

"tarry ye here, and watch with me. And he went a little further, and fell on "

"unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, "
"could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into "
"temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went "
"away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may "

"Cependant Marie se tenait dehors près du sépulcre, et pleurait. Comme elle "
"pleurait, elle se baissa pour regarder dans le sépulcre; et elle vit deux "
"anges vêtus de blanc, assis à la place où avait été couché le corps de "
"Jésus, l'un à la tête, l'autre aux pieds. Ils lui dirent: Femme, pourquoi "
"pleures-tu? Elle leur répondit: Parce qu'ils ont enlevé mon Seigneur, et je "
"ne sais où ils l'ont mis. En disant cela, elle se retourna, et elle vit "
"Jésus debout; mais elle ne savait pas que c'était Jésus. Jésus lui dit: "
"Femme, pourquoi pleures-tu? Qui cherches-tu? Elle, pensant que c'était le "
"jardinier, lui dit: Seigneur, si c'est toi qui l'as emporté, dis-moi où tu "
"l'as mis, et je le prendrai. Jésus lui dit: Marie! Elle se retourna, et lui "
"dit en hébreu: Rabbouni! C'est-à-dire, Maître! Jésus lui dit: Ne me touche "
"pas; car je ne suis pas encore monté vers mon Père. Mais va trouver mes "
"frères, et dis-leur que je monte vers mon Père et votre Père, vers mon Dieu "
"et votre Dieu. Marie de Magdala alla annoncer aux disciples qu'elle avait vu "
"le Seigneur, et qu'il lui avait dit ces choses. Le soir de ce jour, qui "
"était le premier de la semaine, les portes du lieu où se trouvaient les "
"disciples étant fermées, à cause de la crainte qu'ils avaient des Juifs, "
"Jésus vint, se présenta au milieu d'eux, et leur dit: La paix soit avec "
"vous! Et quand il eut dit cela, il leur montra ses mains et son côté. Les "
"disciples furent dans la joie en voyant le Seigneur. Jésus leur dit de "
"nouveau: La paix soit avec vous! Comme le Père m'a envoyé, moi aussi je vous "
"envoie. Après ces paroles, il souffla sur eux, et leur dit: Recevez le "
"Saint-Esprit. Ceux à qui vous pardonnerez les péchés, ils leur seront "
"pardonnés; et ceux à qui vous les retiendrez, ils leur seront retenus. "
"Thomas, appelé Didyme, l'un des douze, n'était pas avec eux lorsque Jésus "

"mets mon doigt dans la marque des clous, et si je ne mets ma main dans son "
"côté, je ne croirai point. Huit jours après, les disciples de Jésus étaient "
"de nouveau dans la maison, et Thomas se trouvait avec eux. Jésus vint, les "
"portes étant fermées, se présenta au milieu d'eux, et dit: La paix soit avec "
"vous! Puis il dit à Thomas: Avance ici ton doigt, et regarde mes mains; "
"avance aussi ta main, et mets-la dans mon côté; et ne sois pas incrédule, "
"mais crois. Thomas lui répondit: Mon Seigneur et mon Dieu! Jésus lui dit: "
"Parce que tu m'as vu, tu as cru. Heureux ceux qui n'ont pas vu, et qui ont "
"cru! Jésus a fait encore, en présence de ses disciples, beaucoup d'autres "
"miracles, qui ne sont pas écrits dans ce livre. Mais ces choses ont été "
