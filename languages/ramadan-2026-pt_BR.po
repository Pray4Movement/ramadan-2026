"Genesis 1:1-25 (ESV)\n"
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was "
"without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the "
"Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be "
"light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God "
"divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the "
"darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first "
"day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and "
"let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and "
"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were "
"above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And "
"the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the "
"waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry "
"land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the "
"gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was "
"good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, "
"and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, "
"upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb "
"yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in "
"itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and "
"the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the "
"firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be "
"for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for "
"lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it "
"was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, "
"and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set "
"them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to "
"rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the "
"darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were "
"the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the "
"moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the "
"open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living "
"creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their "
"kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. "
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters "
"in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the "
"morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the "
"living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the "
"earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth "
"after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth "
"upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."

"No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra. E a terra era sem forma e vazia; "
"e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a "
"face das águas. E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz. E viu Deus que era boa "
"a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas. E Deus chamou à luz "
"Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro. E "
"disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre "
"águas e águas. E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que "
"estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim "
"foi. E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo. "
"E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a "
"porção seca; e assim foi. E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao "
"ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom. E disse Deus: "
"Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê "
"fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim "
"foi. E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a "
"árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus "
"que era bom. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro. E disse Deus: Haja "
"luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; "
"e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos. E "
"sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim "
"foi. E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o "
"dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas. E Deus os "
"pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra, E para governar o dia e a "
"noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era "
"bom. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto. E disse Deus: Produzam as águas "
"abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da "
"expansão dos céus. E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma "
"vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e "
"toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom. E Deus os "
"abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos "
"mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia "
"quinto. E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; "
"gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi. E fez "
"Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua "
"espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era "

"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD "
"God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not "
"eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may "
"eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree "
"which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, "
"neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, "
"Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, "
"then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and "
"evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it "
"was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she "
"took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with "
"her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew "
"that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made "
"themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the "
"garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the "
"presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. And the LORD God "
"called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard "
"thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid "
"myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of "
"the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man "
"said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and "
"I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast "
"done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the "
"LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed "
"above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt "
"thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put "
"enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it "
"shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Unto the woman he "
"said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou "
"shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he "
"shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened "
"unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded "
"thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; "
"in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and "
"thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the "
"field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto "
"the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust "
"shalt thou return. And Adam called his wife\\'s name Eve; because she was "
"the mother of all living. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God "
"make coats of skins, and clothed them. And the LORD God said, Behold, the "
"man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put "
"forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for "
"ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till "
"the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed "

"dor comerás dela todos os dias da tua vida. Espinhos, e cardos também, te "

"took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other "

"carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said "
"unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great "
"calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have "
"no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner "
"of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came over "
"unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And when "
"he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a "
"man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man "
"could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound "
"with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and "
"the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. And always, "
"night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and "
"cutting himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and "

"with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that "
"thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean "

"prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, "

"went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that "
"exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be "
"exalted. And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: "
"but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto "
"him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: "
"for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall "

"none is good, save one, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not "
"commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, "
"Honour thy father and thy mother. And he said, All these have I kept from my "

"thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and "
"thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. And when he heard "
"this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. And when Jesus saw that "

"you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the "

"his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is "

"Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. His "

"there is no light in him. These things said he: and after that he saith unto "

"Estava, porém, enfermo um certo Lázaro, de Betânia, aldeia de Maria e de sua "
"irmã Marta. E Maria era aquela que tinha ungido o Senhor com unguento, e lhe "
"tinha enxugado os pés com os seus cabelos, cujo irmão Lázaro estava enfermo. "
"Mandaram-lhe, pois, suas irmãs dizer: Senhor, eis que está enfermo aquele "
"que tu amas. E Jesus, ouvindo isto, disse: Esta enfermidade não é para "
"morte, mas para glória de Deus, para que o Filho de Deus seja glorificado "
"por ela. Ora, Jesus amava a Marta, e a sua irmã, e a Lázaro. Quando ouviu, "
"pois, que estava enfermo, ficou ainda dois dias no lugar onde estava. Então, "
"depois disto, disse aos seus discípulos: Vamos outra vez para a Judeia. "
"Disseram-lhe os discípulos: Rabi, ainda agora os judeus procuravam apedrejar-"
"te, e tornas para lá? Jesus respondeu: Não há doze horas no dia? Se alguém "
"andar de dia, não tropeça, porque vê a luz deste mundo; Mas, se andar de "
"noite, tropeça, porque nele não há luz. Assim falou; e depois disso disse-"
"lhes: Lázaro, o nosso amigo, dorme, mas vou despertá-lo do sono. Disseram, "
"pois, os seus discípulos: Senhor, se dorme, estará salvo. Mas Jesus dizia "
"isto da sua morte; eles, porém, cuidavam que falava do repouso do sono. "
"Então pois, Jesus disse-lhes claramente: Lázaro está morto; E folgo, por "
"amor de vós, de que eu lá não estivesse, para que acrediteis; mas vamos ter "
"com ele. Disse, pois, Tomé, chamado Dídimo, aos condiscípulos: Vamos nós "
"também, para morrermos com ele. Chegando, pois, Jesus, achou que já havia "
"quatro dias que estava na sepultura. (Ora Betânia distava de Jerusalém quase "
"quinze estádios.) E muitos dos judeus tinham ido consolar a Marta e a Maria, "
"acerca de seu irmão. Ouvindo, pois, Marta que Jesus vinha, saiu-lhe ao "
"encontro; Maria, porém, ficou assentada em casa. Disse, pois, Marta a Jesus: "
"Senhor, se tu estivesses aqui, meu irmão não teria morrido. Mas também agora "
"sei que tudo quanto pedires a Deus, Deus to concederá. Disse-lhe Jesus: Teu "
"irmão há de ressuscitar. Disse-lhe Marta: Eu sei que há de ressuscitar na "
"ressurreição do último dia. Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou a ressurreição e a vida; "
"quem crê em mim, ainda que esteja morto, viverá; E todo aquele que vive, e "
"crê em mim, nunca irá morrer. Crês tu isto? Disse-lhe ela: Sim, Senhor, "
"creio que tu és o Cristo, o Filho de Deus, que havia de vir ao mundo. E, "
"dito isto, partiu, e chamou em segredo a Maria, sua irmã, dizendo: O Mestre "
"está cá, e chama-te. Ela, ouvindo isto, levantou-se logo, e foi ter com ele. "
"(Pois, Jesus ainda não tinha chegado à aldeia, mas estava no lugar onde "
"Marta o encontrara.) Vendo, pois, os judeus, que estavam com ela em casa e a "
"consolavam, que Maria apressadamente se levantara e saíra, seguiram-na, "
"dizendo: Vai ao sepulcro para chorar ali. Tendo, pois, Maria chegado aonde "
"Jesus estava, e vendo-o, lançou-se aos seus pés, dizendo-lhe: Senhor, se tu "
"estivesses aqui, meu irmão não teria morrido. Jesus pois, quando a viu "
"chorar, e também chorando os judeus que com ela vinham, moveu-se muito em "
"espírito, e perturbou-se. E disse: Onde o pusestes? Disseram-lhe: Senhor, "
"vem, e vê. Jesus chorou. Disseram, pois, os judeus: Vede como o amava. E "
"alguns deles disseram: Não podia ele, que abriu os olhos ao cego, fazer "
"também com que este não morresse? Jesus, pois, movendo-se outra vez muito em "
"si mesmo, veio ao sepulcro; e era uma caverna, e tinha uma pedra posta sobre "
"ela. Disse Jesus: Tirai a pedra. Marta, irmã do defunto, disse-lhe: Senhor, "
"já cheira mal, porque é já de quatro dias. Disse-lhe Jesus: Não te tenho "
"dito que, se creres, verás a glória de Deus? Tiraram, pois, a pedra de onde "
"o defunto jazia. E Jesus, levantando os olhos para cima, disse: Pai, graças "
"te dou, por me haveres ouvido. Eu bem sei que sempre me ouves, mas eu disse "
"isto por causa da multidão que está em redor, para que creiam que tu me "
"enviaste. E, tendo dito isto, clamou com grande voz: Lázaro, sai para fora. "
"E o que fora defunto saiu, tendo as mãos e os pés ligados com faixas, e o "
"seu rosto envolto num lenço. Disse-lhes Jesus: Desligai-o, e deixai-o ir."

"Matthew 26:36-56 (ESV)\n"
"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto "
"the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. And he took with him "
"Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. "
"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: "
"tarry ye here, and watch with me. And he went a little further, and fell on "
"his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup "
"pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he cometh "
"unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, "
"could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into "
"temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went "
"away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may "
"not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. And he came and "
"found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And he left them, and "
"went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then "
"cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your "
"rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the "
"hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth "
"betray me. And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and "
"with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests "
"and elders of the people. Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "
"Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. And forthwith he "
"came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And Jesus said unto "
"him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on "
"Jesus, and took him. And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus "
"stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high "
"priest\\'s, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again "
"thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with "
"the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall "
"presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the "
"scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? In that same hour said Jesus "
"to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves "
"for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no "
"hold on me. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might "
"be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."

"Mateus 26:36-56 (ACF)\n"
"Então chegou Jesus com eles a um lugar chamado Getsêmani, e disse a seus "
"discípulos: Assentai-vos aqui, enquanto vou além orar. E, levando consigo "
"Pedro e os dois filhos de Zebedeu, começou a entristecer-se e a angustiar-se "
"muito. Então lhes disse: A minha alma está cheia de tristeza até a morte; "
"ficai aqui, e velai comigo. E, indo um pouco mais para diante, prostrou-se "
"sobre o seu rosto, orando e dizendo: Meu Pai, se é possível, passe de mim "
"este cálice; todavia, não seja como eu quero, mas como tu queres. E, "
"voltando para os seus discípulos, achou-os adormecidos; e disse a Pedro: "
"Então nem uma hora pudeste velar comigo? Vigiai e orai, para que não entreis "
"em tentação; na verdade, o espírito está pronto, mas a carne é fraca. E, "
"indo segunda vez, orou, dizendo: Pai meu, se este cálice não pode passar de "
"mim sem eu o beber, faça-se a tua vontade. E, voltando, achou-os outra vez "
"adormecidos; porque os seus olhos estavam pesados. E, deixando-os de novo, "
"foi orar pela terceira vez, dizendo as mesmas palavras. Então chegou junto "
"dos seus discípulos, e disse-lhes: Dormi agora, e repousai; eis que é "
"chegada a hora, e o Filho do homem será entregue nas mãos dos pecadores. "
"Levantai-vos, partamos; eis que é chegado o que me trai. E, estando ele "
"ainda a falar, eis que chegou Judas, um dos doze, e com ele grande multidão "
"com espadas e varapaus, enviada pelos principais sacerdotes e pelos anciãos "
"do povo. E o que o traía tinha-lhes dado um sinal, dizendo: O que eu beijar "
"é esse; prendei-o. E logo, aproximando-se de Jesus, disse: Eu te saúdo, "
"Rabi; e beijou-o. Jesus, porém, lhe disse: Amigo, a que vieste? Então, "
"aproximando-se eles, lançaram mão de Jesus, e o prenderam. E eis que um dos "
"que estavam com Jesus, estendendo a mão, puxou da espada e, ferindo o servo "
"do sumo sacerdote, cortou-lhe uma orelha. Então Jesus disse-lhe: Embainha a "
"tua espada; porque todos os que lançarem mão da espada, à espada morrerão. "
"Ou pensas tu que eu não poderia agora orar a meu Pai, e que ele não me daria "
"mais de doze legiões de anjos? Como, pois, se cumpririam as Escrituras, que "
"dizem que assim convém que aconteça? Então disse Jesus à multidão: Saístes, "
"como para um salteador, com espadas e varapaus para me prender? Todos os "
"dias me assentava junto de vós, ensinando no templo, e não me prendestes. "
"Mas tudo isto aconteceu para que se cumpram as escrituras dos profetas. "
"Então, todos os discípulos, deixando-o, fugiram."

"Halima had heard the stories of Jesus. She asked for them to be told to her "

"Jesus is the only way. She couldn't bear to believe that God would not "
"overlook their unbelief in Jesus because of their devout sincerity. She was "
"sure that God would see their \"good lives\", forgive them, and grant them "
"eternal life. She began saying her Muslim prayers more devoutly, counting "
"them with beads, fasting twice a week, and was careful to dress modestly. "
"She said, \"It is just clear what is good and what is bad. You can feel it."

"Like many others, Halima believed the lie that we define the way to God – "

"And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. "
"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they "
"crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on "
"the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they "
"do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood "
"beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved "
"others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. And the "
"soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, And "
"saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a superscription "
"also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS "
"IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed "
"on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other "
"answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in "
"the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward "
"of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, "
"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto "
"him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. And "
"it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth "
"until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple "
"was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "
"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up "
"the ghost. Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, "
"saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. And all the people that came "
"together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their "
"breasts, and returned. And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed "
"him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. And, behold, there "
"was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: "
"(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of "
"Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of "
"God. This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And he took it "
"down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in "
"stone, wherein never man before was laid. And that day was the preparation, "
"and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from "
"Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was "
"laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the "

"E também conduziram outros dois, que eram malfeitores, para com ele serem "
"mortos. E, quando chegaram ao lugar chamado a Caveira, ali o crucificaram, e "
"aos malfeitores, um à direita e outro à esquerda. E dizia Jesus: Pai, "

"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she "

"Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith "
"unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they "
"have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw "
"Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, "
"why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, "
"saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast "
"laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned "
"herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith "
"unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my "
"brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and "
"to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she "
"had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then the "
"same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were "
"shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and "
"stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had "
"so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples "
"glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto "
"you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said "
"this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: "
"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever "
"sins ye retain, they are retained. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called "
"Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore "
"said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall "

"of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the "
"throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their "
"hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which "
"sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round "
"about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before "
"the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and "
"glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be "
"unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying "
"unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came "
"they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are "
"they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and "
"made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the "
"throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that "
"sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, "
"neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. "

"diante do trono, e perante o Cordeiro, trajando vestes brancas e com palmas "

"que está assentado no trono, e ao Cordeiro. E todos os anjos estavam ao "
"redor do trono, e dos anciãos, e dos quatro animais; e prostraram-se diante "
"do trono sobre seus rostos, e adoraram a Deus, Dizendo: Amém. Louvor, e "
"glória, e sabedoria, e ação de graças, e honra, e poder, e força ao nosso "
"Deus, para todo o sempre. Amém. E um dos anciãos me falou, dizendo: Estes "
"que estão vestidos de vestes brancas, quem são, e de onde vieram? E eu "
"disse-lhe: Senhor, tu sabes. E ele disse-me: Estes são os que vieram da "
"grande tribulação, e lavaram as suas vestes e as branquearam no sangue do "
