"Genesis 1:1-25 (ESV)\n"
"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was "
"without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the "
"Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, \"Let "
"there be light,\" and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. "
"And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and "
"the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, "
"the first day. And God said, \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the "
"waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.\" And God made the "
"expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters "
"that were above the expanse. And it was so. And God called the expanse "
"Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. And God "
"said, \"Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one "
"place, and let the dry land appear.\" And it was so. God called the dry land "
"Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God "
"saw that it was good. And God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, "
"plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, "
"each according to its kind, on the earth.\" And it was so. The earth brought "
"forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and "
"trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And "
"God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the "
"third day. And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens "
"to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for "
"seasons, and for days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of "
"the heavens to give light upon the earth.\" And it was so. And God made the "
"two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to "
"rule the night—and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens "
"to give light on the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to "
"separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And "
"there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day. And God said, \"Let "
"the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above "
"the earth across the expanse of the heavens.\" So God created the great sea "
"creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, "
"according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And "
"God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, \"Be fruitful and "
"multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the "
"earth.\" And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. And God "
"said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—"
"livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their "
"kinds.\" And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to "
"their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that "
"creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good."

"No princípio criou Deus os céus e a terra. E a terra era sem forma e vazia; "
"e havia trevas sobre a face do abismo; e o Espírito de Deus se movia sobre a "
"face das águas. E disse Deus: Haja luz; e houve luz. E viu Deus que era boa "
"a luz; e fez Deus separação entre a luz e as trevas. E Deus chamou à luz "
"Dia; e às trevas chamou Noite. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia primeiro. E "
"disse Deus: Haja uma expansão no meio das águas, e haja separação entre "
"águas e águas. E fez Deus a expansão, e fez separação entre as águas que "
"estavam debaixo da expansão e as águas que estavam sobre a expansão; e assim "
"foi. E chamou Deus à expansão Céus, e foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia segundo. "
"E disse Deus: Ajuntem-se as águas debaixo dos céus num lugar; e apareça a "
"porção seca; e assim foi. E chamou Deus à porção seca Terra; e ao "
"ajuntamento das águas chamou Mares; e viu Deus que era bom. E disse Deus: "
"Produza a terra erva verde, erva que dê semente, árvore frutífera que dê "
"fruto segundo a sua espécie, cuja semente está nela sobre a terra; e assim "
"foi. E a terra produziu erva, erva dando semente conforme a sua espécie, e a "
"árvore frutífera, cuja semente está nela conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus "
"que era bom. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia terceiro. E disse Deus: Haja "
"luminares na expansão dos céus, para haver separação entre o dia e a noite; "
"e sejam eles para sinais e para tempos determinados e para dias e anos. E "
"sejam para luminares na expansão dos céus, para iluminar a terra; e assim "
"foi. E fez Deus os dois grandes luminares: o luminar maior para governar o "
"dia, e o luminar menor para governar a noite; e fez as estrelas. E Deus os "
"pôs na expansão dos céus para iluminar a terra, E para governar o dia e a "
"noite, e para fazer separação entre a luz e as trevas; e viu Deus que era "
"bom. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia quarto. E disse Deus: Produzam as águas "
"abundantemente répteis de alma vivente; e voem as aves sobre a face da "
"expansão dos céus. E Deus criou as grandes baleias, e todo o réptil de alma "
"vivente que as águas abundantemente produziram conforme as suas espécies; e "
"toda a ave de asas conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era bom. E Deus os "
"abençoou, dizendo: Frutificai e multiplicai-vos, e enchei as águas nos "
"mares; e as aves se multipliquem na terra. E foi a tarde e a manhã, o dia "
"quinto. E disse Deus: Produza a terra alma vivente conforme a sua espécie; "
"gado, e répteis e feras da terra conforme a sua espécie; e assim foi. E fez "
"Deus as feras da terra conforme a sua espécie, e o gado conforme a sua "
"espécie, e todo o réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie; e viu Deus que era "

"\"We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You "
"shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, "

"when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a "
"delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, "
"she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was "
"with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that "
"they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves "

"whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.\" "
"Then the LORD God said to the woman, \"What is this that you have done?\" "
"The woman said, \"The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\" The LORD God said to "
"the serpent, \"Because you have done this, cursed are you above all "
"livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and "

"\" And to Adam he said, \"Because you have listened to the voice of your "

"the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and "

"great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you "

"\" So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was "

"wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had "
"gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out "
"to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, Abram "
"passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At "
"that time the Canaanites were in the land. Then the LORD appeared to Abram "
"and said, \"To your offspring I will give this land.\" So he built there an "
"altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.\n"

"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: \"Fear "

"heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\" And Abram said, \"Behold, you "
"have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.\" "
"And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: \"This man shall not be your "
"heir; your very own son shall be your heir.\" And he brought him outside and "
"said, \"Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number "

"After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, \"Abraham!\" And he "

"went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted "

"\"Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship "
"and come again to you.\" And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and "

"father!\" And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" He said, \"Behold, the fire "
"and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" Abraham said, "
"\"God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So "
"they went both of them together. When they came to the place of which God "

"LORD will provide\"; as it is said to this day, \"On the mount of the LORD "

"Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and "
"shall be exalted. Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom "
"has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For he grew up before him like a "
"young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty "
"that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was "
"despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; "
"and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed "
"him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we "
"esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for "
"our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the "
"chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. All "
"we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and "
"the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he "
"was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the "
"slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened "
"not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his "
"generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the "
"living, stricken for the transgression of my people? And they made his grave "
"with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no "
"violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the "
"LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering "
"for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will "
"of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. Out of the anguish of his soul he "
"shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my "
"servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their "
"iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he "
"shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to "
"death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, "

"sublime. Como pasmaram muitos à vista dele, pois o seu parecer estava tão "
"desfigurado, mais do que o de outro qualquer, e a sua figura mais do que a "

"fecharão as suas bocas por causa dele; porque aquilo que não lhes foi "
"anunciado verão, e aquilo que eles não ouviram entenderão. Quem deu crédito "
"à nossa pregação? E a quem se manifestou o braço do Senhor? Porque foi "
"subindo como renovo perante ele, e como raiz de uma terra seca; não tinha "
"beleza nem formosura e, olhando nós para ele, não havia boa aparência nele, "
"para que o desejássemos. Era desprezado, e o mais rejeitado entre os homens, "
"homem de dores, e experimentado nos sofrimentos; e, como um de quem os "
"homens escondiam o rosto, era desprezado, e não fizemos dele caso algum. "
"Verdadeiramente ele tomou sobre si as nossas enfermidades, e as nossas dores "
"levou sobre si; e nós o reputávamos por aflito, ferido de Deus, e oprimido. "
"Mas ele foi ferido por causa das nossas transgressões, e moído por causa das "
"nossas iniquidades; o castigo que nos traz a paz estava sobre ele, e pelas "
"suas pisaduras fomos sarados. Todos nós andávamos desgarrados como ovelhas; "
"cada um se desviava pelo seu caminho; mas o Senhor fez cair sobre ele a "
"iniquidade de nós todos. Ele foi oprimido e afligido, mas não abriu a sua "
"boca; como um cordeiro foi levado ao matadouro, e como a ovelha muda perante "
"os seus tosquiadores, assim ele não abriu a sua boca. Da opressão e do juízo "
"foi tirado; e quem contará o tempo da sua vida? Porquanto foi cortado da "
"terra dos viventes; pela transgressão do meu povo ele foi atingido. E "
"puseram a sua sepultura com os ímpios, e com o rico na sua morte; ainda que "
"nunca cometeu injustiça, nem houve engano na sua boca. Todavia, ao Senhor "
"agradou moê-lo, fazendo-o enfermar; quando a sua alma se puser por expiação "
"do pecado, verá a sua posteridade, prolongará os seus dias; e o bom prazer "
"do Senhor prosperará na sua mão. Ele verá o fruto do trabalho da sua alma, e "
"ficará satisfeito; com o seu conhecimento o meu servo, o justo, justificará "
"a muitos; porque as iniquidades deles levará sobre si. Por isso lhe darei a "
"parte de muitos, e com os poderosos repartirá ele o despojo; porquanto "
"derramou a sua alma na morte, e foi contado com os transgressores; mas ele "

"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, \"Let us go across to "
"the other side.\" And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the "
"boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. And a great windstorm "
"arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was "
"already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they "
"woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
"\" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, \"Peace! Be still!"
"\" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, \"Why "
"are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?\" And they were filled with "
"great fear and said to one another, \"Who then is this, that even the wind "
"and the sea obey him?\" They came to the other side of the sea, to the "
"country of the Gerasenes. And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, "
"immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. He "
"lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a "
"chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched "
"the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the "
"strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains "
"he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. And when he saw "
"Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. And crying out with a loud "
"voice, he said, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High "
"God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.\" For he was saying to him, "
"\"Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!\" And Jesus asked him, \"What is "
"your name?\" He replied, \"My name is Legion, for we are many.\" And he "
"begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. Now a great herd "
"of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him, saying, "
"\"Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.\" So he gave them permission. And "
"the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering "
"about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned "
"in the sea. The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. "
"And people came to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus "
"and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting "
"there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who "
"had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man "
"and to the pigs. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. As "
"he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons "
"begged him that he might be with him. And he did not permit him but said to "
"him, \"Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for "
"you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" And he went away and began to "
"proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone "

"encontro, dos sepulcros, um homem com espírito imundo; O qual tinha a sua "
"morada nos sepulcros, e nem ainda com cadeias o podia alguém prender; "
"Porque, tendo sido muitas vezes preso com grilhões e cadeias, as cadeias "
"foram por ele feitas em pedaços, e os grilhões em migalhas, e ninguém o "

"(Porque lhe dizia: Sai deste homem, espírito imundo.) E perguntou-lhe: Qual "

"He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were "
"righteous, and treated others with contempt: \"Two men went up into the "
"temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, "
"standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other "
"men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I "
"fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.' But the tax collector, "
"standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his "
"breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!' I tell you, this man "
"went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who "
"exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be "
"exalted.\" Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch "
"them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called "
"them to him, saying, \"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, "
"for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does "
"not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" And a "
"ruler asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" "
"And Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God "
"alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do "
"not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.' \" And "
"he said, \"All these I have kept from my youth.\" When Jesus heard this, he "
"said to him, \"One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and "
"distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, "
"follow me.\" But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was "

"it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is "
"easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person "
"to enter the kingdom of God.\" Those who heard it said, \"Then who can be "

"Jejuo duas vezes na semana, e dou os dízimos de tudo quanto possuo. O "

"Luke 15:1-32 (ESV)\n"
"Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. And "
"the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, \"This man receives sinners "
"and eats with them.\" So he told them this parable: \"What man of you, "
"having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the "
"ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he "
"finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. "
"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, "
"saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' "
"Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who "
"repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. \"Or "
"what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a "
"lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when "
"she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, "
"'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.' Just so, I "
"tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
"\" And he said, \"There was a man who had two sons. And the younger of them "
"said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to "
"me.' And he divided his property between them. Not many days later, the "
"younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and "
"there he squandered his property in reckless living. And when he had spent "
"everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in "
"need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that "
"country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. And he was longing to be "
"fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything. \"But "
"when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants "
"have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and "
"go to my father, and I will say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against "
"heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me "
"as one of your hired servants.\" ' And he arose and came to his father. But "
"while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, "
"and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, 'Father, I "
"have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be "
"called your son.' But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the "
"best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his "
"feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. "
"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.'And "
"they began to celebrate. \"Now his older son was in the field, and as he "
"came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called "
"one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, "
"'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, "
"because he has received him back safe and sound.' But he was angry and "
"refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his "
"father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed "
"your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate "
"with my friends. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your "
"property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' And he "
"said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It "

"\"Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going "

"So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, \"Let us also go, "

"already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two "
"miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them "

"die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall "
"never die. Do you believe this?\" She said to him, \"Yes, Lord; I believe "
"that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.\" "
"When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in "
"private, \"The Teacher is here and is calling for you.\" And when she heard "
"it, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the "
"village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews "
"who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go "
"out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep "
"there. Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his "
"feet, saying to him, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have "

"said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept "
"this man from dying?\" Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It "
"was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" "
"Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, \"Lord, by this time there "
"will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.\" Jesus said to her, \"Did "
"I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?\" So "

"andar de dia, não tropeça, porque vê a luz deste mundo; Mas, se andar de "
"noite, tropeça, porque nele não há luz. Assim falou; e depois disso disse-"
"lhes: Lázaro, o nosso amigo, dorme, mas vou despertá-lo do sono. Disseram, "
"pois, os seus discípulos: Senhor, se dorme, estará salvo. Mas Jesus dizia "
"isto da sua morte; eles, porém, cuidavam que falava do repouso do sono. "
"Então pois, Jesus disse-lhes claramente: Lázaro está morto; E folgo, por "
"amor de vós, de que eu lá não estivesse, para que acrediteis; mas vamos ter "
"com ele. Disse, pois, Tomé, chamado Dídimo, aos condiscípulos: Vamos nós "
"também, para morrermos com ele. Chegando, pois, Jesus, achou que já havia "
"quatro dias que estava na sepultura. (Ora Betânia distava de Jerusalém quase "
"quinze estádios.) E muitos dos judeus tinham ido consolar a Marta e a Maria, "
"acerca de seu irmão. Ouvindo, pois, Marta que Jesus vinha, saiu-lhe ao "
"encontro; Maria, porém, ficou assentada em casa. Disse, pois, Marta a Jesus: "
"Senhor, se tu estivesses aqui, meu irmão não teria morrido. Mas também agora "
"sei que tudo quanto pedires a Deus, Deus to concederá. Disse-lhe Jesus: Teu "
"irmão há de ressuscitar. Disse-lhe Marta: Eu sei que há de ressuscitar na "
"ressurreição do último dia. Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou a ressurreição e a vida; "
"quem crê em mim, ainda que esteja morto, viverá; E todo aquele que vive, e "
"crê em mim, nunca irá morrer. Crês tu isto? Disse-lhe ela: Sim, Senhor, "
"creio que tu és o Cristo, o Filho de Deus, que havia de vir ao mundo. E, "
"dito isto, partiu, e chamou em segredo a Maria, sua irmã, dizendo: O Mestre "
"está cá, e chama-te. Ela, ouvindo isto, levantou-se logo, e foi ter com ele. "
"(Pois, Jesus ainda não tinha chegado à aldeia, mas estava no lugar onde "
"Marta o encontrara.) Vendo, pois, os judeus, que estavam com ela em casa e a "
"consolavam, que Maria apressadamente se levantara e saíra, seguiram-na, "
"dizendo: Vai ao sepulcro para chorar ali. Tendo, pois, Maria chegado aonde "
"Jesus estava, e vendo-o, lançou-se aos seus pés, dizendo-lhe: Senhor, se tu "
"estivesses aqui, meu irmão não teria morrido. Jesus pois, quando a viu "
"chorar, e também chorando os judeus que com ela vinham, moveu-se muito em "
"espírito, e perturbou-se. E disse: Onde o pusestes? Disseram-lhe: Senhor, "
"vem, e vê. Jesus chorou. Disseram, pois, os judeus: Vede como o amava. E "
"alguns deles disseram: Não podia ele, que abriu os olhos ao cego, fazer "
"também com que este não morresse? Jesus, pois, movendo-se outra vez muito em "
"si mesmo, veio ao sepulcro; e era uma caverna, e tinha uma pedra posta sobre "
"ela. Disse Jesus: Tirai a pedra. Marta, irmã do defunto, disse-lhe: Senhor, "
"já cheira mal, porque é já de quatro dias. Disse-lhe Jesus: Não te tenho "
"dito que, se creres, verás a glória de Deus? Tiraram, pois, a pedra de onde "
"o defunto jazia. E Jesus, levantando os olhos para cima, disse: Pai, graças "
"te dou, por me haveres ouvido. Eu bem sei que sempre me ouves, mas eu disse "
"isto por causa da multidão que está em redor, para que creiam que tu me "
"enviaste. E, tendo dito isto, clamou com grande voz: Lázaro, sai para fora. "
"E o que fora defunto saiu, tendo as mãos e os pés ligados com faixas, e o "
"seu rosto envolto num lenço. Disse-lhes Jesus: Desligai-o, e deixai-o ir."

"podia contar, de todas as nações, e tribos, e povos, e línguas, que estavam "
"diante do trono, e perante o Cordeiro, trajando vestes brancas e com palmas "
"nas suas mãos; E clamavam com grande voz, dizendo: Salvação ao nosso Deus, "
"que está assentado no trono, e ao Cordeiro. E todos os anjos estavam ao "
"redor do trono, e dos anciãos, e dos quatro animais; e prostraram-se diante "
"do trono sobre seus rostos, e adoraram a Deus, Dizendo: Amém. Louvor, e "
"glória, e sabedoria, e ação de graças, e honra, e poder, e força ao nosso "
"Deus, para todo o sempre. Amém. E um dos anciãos me falou, dizendo: Estes "
"que estão vestidos de vestes brancas, quem são, e de onde vieram? E eu "
"disse-lhe: Senhor, tu sabes. E ele disse-me: Estes são os que vieram da "
"grande tribulação, e lavaram as suas vestes e as branquearam no sangue do "
"Cordeiro. Por isso estão diante do trono de Deus, e o servem de dia e de "
"noite no seu templo; e aquele que está assentado sobre o trono os cobrirá "
"com a sua sombra. Nunca mais terão fome, nunca mais terão sede; nem sol nem "
"calor algum cairá sobre eles. Porque o Cordeiro que está no meio do trono "
"os apascentará, e lhes servirá de guia para as fontes vivas das águas; e "
"Deus limpará de seus olhos toda a lágrima."
